This repository is associated with the paper titled ``Identifiable and interpretable nonparametric factor analysis'' (available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08254).

To run simulations, follow the example in example_run.R to run the Bayesian ICA example for factor analysis of non-Gaussian data.

curve_nifty.R provides another example of curve-shaped data included in the paper.
